  "readme": "# ember-cli-sass\n\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-sass.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-sass)\n[![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-cli-sass.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-cli-sass)\n[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass.svg)](https://david-dm.org/aexmachina/ember-cli-sass)\n\nember-cli-sass uses libsass to preprocess your ember-cli app's files and provides support for source maps and include paths. It provides support for the common use case for Ember.js projects:\n\n- Source maps by default in development\n- Support for [`outputPaths` configuration](http://www.ember-cli.com/#configuring-output-paths)\n- Provides the ability to specify include paths\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev ember-cli-sass\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nBy default this addon will compile `app/styles/app.scss` or `app/styles/app.sass` into `dist/assets/app.css` and produce \na source map for your delectation.\n\nIf you want more control then you can specify options using the\n`sassOptions` config property in `ember-cli-build.js` (or in `Brocfile.js` if you are using an Ember CLI version older than 1.13):\n\n```javascript\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  sassOptions: {...}\n});\n```\n\n- `includePaths`: an array of include paths\n- `sourceMap`: controls whether to generate sourceMaps, defaults to `true` in development. The sourceMap file will be saved to `options.outputFile + '.map'`\n- `extension`: specifies the file extension for the input files, defaults to `scss`\n- See [broccoli-sass-source-maps](https://github.com/aexmachina/broccoli-sass-source-maps) for a list of other supported options.\n\n### Processing multiple files\n\nIf you need to process multiple files, it can be done by [configuring the output paths](http://www.ember-cli.com/#configuring-output-paths) in your `ember-cli-build.js`:\n\n```js\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  outputPaths: {\n    app: {\n      css: {\n        'app': '/assets/application-name.css',\n        'themes/alpha': '/assets/themes/alpha.css'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Upgrading from a previous version\n\nIn a previous versions the `sassOptions` config property was incorrectly moved to the `config/environment.js` file. This usage is deprecated, and you should specify the config in the `ember-cli-build.js`.\n\nIn versions of Ember CLI before 1.13 the `sassOptions` config property was placed in `Brocfile.js`, this has since been deprecated. If you are upgrading from an older verion of Ember CLI move your `sassOptions` to `ember-cli-build.js` and remove your Brocfile. For more information check out the [Ember CLI Brocfile transition guide](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/blob/master/TRANSITION.md#brocfile-transition).\n\nIf you were using the `inputFile` and `outputFile` options, this is now done by [configuring the output paths](http://www.ember-cli.com/#configuring-output-paths) in `ember-cli-build.js`.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example assumes your bower packages are installed into `bower_components/`.\n\nInstall some SASS:\n\n```shell\nbower install --save foundation\n```\n\nSpecify some include paths in your `ember-cli-build.js`:\n\n```javascript\nvar app = new EmberApp({\n  sassOptions: {\n    includePaths: [\n      'bower_components/foundation/scss'\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\nImport some deps into your app.scss:\n\n```scss\n@import 'foundation'; /* import everything */\n/* or just import the bits you need: @import 'foundation/functions'; */\n```\n\n## Addon Usage\n\nTo compile SASS within an ember-cli addon, there are a few additional steps:\n\n1. Include your styles in `addon/styles/addon.scss`.\n\n2. Ensure you've installed `ember-cli-sass` under `dependencies` in your\n   `package.json`.\n\n3. Define an `included` function in your app:\n   ```js\n   // in your index.js\n   module.exports = {\n     name: 'my-addon',\n     included: function(app) {\n       this._super.included(app);\n     }\n   };\n   ```\n   \n   If you omit this step, it will throw the following error:\n   ```\n   Cannot read property 'sassOptions' of undefined\n   TypeError: Cannot read property 'sassOptions' of undefined\n   at Class.module.exports.sassOptions (~/my-plugin/node_modules/ember-cli-sass/index.js:43:48)\n   ```\n\n4. Make sure your dummy app contains an `app.scss`\n\n5. If you run `ember build dist`, your styles from `addon/styles/addon.scss`\n   should appear correctly in `dist/assets/vendor.css`\n\nFor an example of an addon that does this correctly, see\n[ember-cli-notifications](https://github.com/Blooie/ember-cli-notifications)\n\n## Source Maps\n\nBe aware that there are [some issues with source maps](https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-sass/issues/39) in broccoli-sass. The source maps it generates will at least show you the source file names and line number in your dev tools. When we've got a better solution in broccoli-sass you'll be able to click through to view and update the SASS files in the dev tools \\o/.\n",
