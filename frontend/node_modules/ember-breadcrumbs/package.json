  "readme": "ember-breadcrumbs\n=================\n\nAn Ember.js component for adding breadcrumbs to your app.\n\n## Installing\n\nInstallation is accomplished by using `ember-cli` addons. From within your\n`ember-cli` app, do:\n\n```\nember install:addon ember-breadcrumbs\n```\n\nIf you have an older version of `ember-cli`, this may not work. If you're sure that your version of `ember-cli` supports addons, then you may be able to use this in lieu of upgrading:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev ember-cli\n```\n\nBut you should probably just upgrade.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo add the breadcrumbs to your app, simply throw the component into one of your\ntemplates: `{{bread-crumbs}}`.\n\nDon't worry about which template. It will automatically update itself as your\nroute changes. There are no options to provide to the component.\n\nFor an example, check out the\n[sample app](https://github.com/chrisfarber/ember-breadcrumbs-sample-app).\n\n### Controlling crumbs\n\nTo display a bread crumb, you define properties on the controller associated\nwith a route. When that route (or a route nested underneath it) is active, the\nbread crumb will be displayed.\n\nThe properties are:\n- **breadCrumb**: The text to display. Required.\n- **breadCrumbPath**: The path (e.g., `\"post.edit\"`) that the crumb will link to.\n  This property is optional; the default will be the route's path.\n- **breadCrumbModel**: An object that will be passed into the `{{link-to}}` helper.\n  This property is optional.\n\nIf the `breadCrumb` property is not specified, then no crumb will be displayed.\nNote that this means, by default, no crumbs will be displayed.\n\n### Dynamic content in crumbs\n\nIf you find yourself needing to add some logic to change what text is displayed in\na breadcrumb (or what path it links to, or the model it provides), there is no need\nto do any thing special.\n\nJust define your `breadCrumb` property (or any other properties) as a computed property that\ndepends on the other information you need. Your breadcrumbs will automatically update in\nrealtime, thanks to Ember.\n\n```js\n  breadCrumb: Ember.computed(\"model.name\", {\n    get() {\n      let modelName = this.get(\"model.name\");\n      return `Blog Post: ${modelName}`;\n    }\n  }),\n  breadCrumbModel: Ember.computed.alias(\"model\")\n```\n\n### Showing multiple crumbs from one controller\n\nSometimes you might need to display multiple breadcrumbs from the same controller.\nTo accomplish this, you can define the `breadCrumbs` property on your controller.\n\nThis property should be an array of objects (one object per crumb) that contain\nthe following attributes:\n- **label**: The text to display as the bread crumb. Required.\n- **path**: The path that the crumb should link to. Optional; if not specified,\n  the controller's route's path will be used instead.\n- **model**: An object that should be passed into `{{link-to}}`. Optional.\n\n## Customization\n\n`ember-breadcrumbs` is styled, by default, for\n[Foundation's Breadcrumbs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/breadcrumbs.html).\n\nThanks to `ember-cli`'s addon support, it's now quite easy to replace this with\nyour own markup. Simply add a template to your project at the path:\n\n```\napp/templates/components/bread-crumbs.hbs\n```\n\nYour template can reference `breadCrumbs`, which is an array of objects containing\nthe following properties:\n\n- **label**: The title of the breadcrumb.\n- **path**: The path that the crumb should link to. Can pass to `link-to`.\n- **model**: The model object that can be passed to `link-to`. May not be present.\n- **linkable**: True unless the controller's breadCrumbPath was false.\n- **isCurrent**: True for the most specific (last) bread crumb, otherwise false.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.\n",
